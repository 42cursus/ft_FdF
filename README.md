## FdF reverse-engineered

This is a source code I recovered via disassembling the example program provided with the subject resources of FdF project.

It's been disassembled and decompiled with help of [Ghidra - Reverse Engineering Framework](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra).

To begin with just execute: ```make all```

Usage: ```./FdF <filename> [ case_size z_size ]```

To close the window just press '5' on the main keyboard (keycode 53)

Hope this helps!)
